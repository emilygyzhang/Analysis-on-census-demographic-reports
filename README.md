# Data Visualization on FFIEC Census Data

This repository stores python scripts I wrote to scrape data presented in census reports from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council website and to visualize the census data

## Here are the main contents in this repository:
* Web Scraping on FFIEC Census Report.md - a Python jupyter notebook
* fips.pkl - data output from Web Scraping on FFIEC Census Report notebook that contains all FIPS codes of states and counties in the United States
* all_states.pkl - data output from Web Scraping on FFIEC Census Report notebook that contains all FFIEC census data of all states and counties in the United States
